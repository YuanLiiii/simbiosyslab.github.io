    The Emory Lab for Computational Systems and their Biologial Connections  
(SimBioSys) is a partnership of researchers exploring the management and
dissemination of information.  Simbiosys lab is run by Drs. Avani Wildani and
Ymir Vigfusson, both of whom are Assistant Professors in Math and Computer
Science.  We are rapidly growing lab and currently support 1 postdoc, 5 PhD
students, 2 MS students, and 4 dedicated undergraduates as well as several
visitors and rotation students.  Our current research areas include such wide
ranging topics as predictive caching, storage system analysis, computer
security, wireless mesh network optimization, biologically plausible neural networks,
theory of learning, and disease transmission network models.
